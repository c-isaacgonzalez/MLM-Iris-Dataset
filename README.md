# MLM-Iris-Dataset
Linear regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forests and K-Means Iris Dataset
Using the iris dataset I apply the following models to the data, allowing it to do classification, predictions a clustering of the different species according to they features.

Linear regression - (supervised, regression).
Logistic Regression - (supervised, classification).
Random Forests  - (supervised, classification).
K-Means - (unsupervised, clustering)



# **Preview of Data**

- There are 150 observations with 4 features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
- There are no null values, so we don't have to worry about that.
- There are 50 observations of each species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).
